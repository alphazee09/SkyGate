# SkyGate AI Detection Application - Features

## Overview

SkyGate is a state-of-the-art application designed to detect whether images and videos are AI-generated or authentic. The application leverages multiple advanced detection techniques to provide accurate analysis with detailed explanations of the results.

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Method AI Detection

SkyGate employs a comprehensive approach to AI-generated content detection by utilizing multiple analysis methods:

#### Vision Transformer (ViT) Analysis
- Treats images as sequences of patches to identify patterns characteristic of AI generation
- Excels at detecting subtle inconsistencies in image structure
- Provides confidence scores based on learned patterns from extensive training data

#### ResNet50 NoDown Architecture
- Specialized neural network architecture designed specifically for GAN detection
- Preserves spatial resolution throughout the network for detailed analysis
- Focuses on identifying artifacts common in GAN-generated images

#### Metadata Examination
- Analyzes EXIF data and other metadata for inconsistencies or missing information
- Identifies suspicious patterns in software signatures and creation timestamps
- Detects manipulation or generation markers left by AI tools

#### Pixel-Level Analysis
- Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) analysis to detect sensor pattern noise inconsistencies
- Error Level Analysis (ELA) to identify compression artifacts typical in AI-generated content
- Texture smoothness detection to find unnaturally consistent areas in generated images

### 2. User-Friendly Interface
